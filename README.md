# üöÄ n8n Perfect Server Setup

Welcome to the **n8n-perfect-server** repository!  
This project helps you easily set up and run an [n8n](https://n8n.io) server ‚Äî an extendable workflow automation tool ‚Äî with Puppeteer integration, PostgreSQL, Redis, Gotenberg, and optional Qdrant vector search. It's optimized for an Ubuntu 22.04 environment.

Get ready to harness the full power of n8n with custom automation, PDF generation, execution history control, secure vector database access, and more!

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- ‚úÖ Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (server recommended)
- ‚úÖ Basic command-line knowledge
- ‚úÖ Git installed (`sudo apt-get install git` if not already installed)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run your n8n instance.

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devsnit/n8n-perfect-server.git
cd n8n-perfect-server
```

---

### 2. Run the Setup Script

To set everything up, simply run the `build.sh` script. This script will:

- Prompt you to choose the n8n version to install (e.g. `latest`, `1.39.1`, etc.)
- Ask for the **Webhook URL**, used for handling webhook callbacks
- Prompt for PostgreSQL credentials (database, user, password)
- Prompt for a Qdrant API key (optional but recommended for security)
- Automatically write all chosen settings into the `.env` file
- Reinstall Docker (if needed) and create the Docker image and network

Make the script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

---

### 3. Start the n8n Server

Once the build completes, start the server with:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

You will be asked whether to run in debug mode (foreground logs) or detached mode.

---

## üåê Accessing the n8n UI

After starting the server, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://<your-server-ip>:5678
```

Replace `<your-server-ip>` with your server‚Äôs IP address or domain name.

---

## üìâ Execution History Configuration

n8n is configured to store execution history, which you can adjust via the `.env` file:

```dotenv
EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS=true      # Save on successful workflow runs
EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR=true        # Save on errors
EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS=true # Save manual executions
EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true                # Automatically delete old data
EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=336               # Max age in hours (336 = 14 days)
```

---

## üîê Qdrant Vector Search (Optional)

This server includes a running instance of [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech), a vector search engine. It's secured with an API key.

To connect, include the following HTTP header:

```http
Authorization: ApiKey YOUR_API_KEY
```

The API key is set during the `build.sh` prompt and stored in `.env` as `QDRANT_API_KEY`.

Qdrant UI / API is available at:
```
http://<your-server-ip>:6333
```

## üß™ Example: n8n Puppeteer to Gotenberg (HTML to PDF)

This is an example workflow using Puppeteer and Gotenberg for HTML to PDF conversion:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "parameters": {
        "operation": "toText",
        "sourceProperty": "html",
        "options": { "fileName": "index.html" }
      },
      "name": "convertToHTML",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "position": [600, 220]
    },
    {
      "parameters": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "http://gotenberg:3000/forms/chromium/convert/html",
        "sendBody": true,
        "contentType": "multipart-form-data",
        "bodyParameters": {
          "parameters": [
            {
              "parameterType": "formBinaryData",
              "name": "files",
              "inputDataFieldName": "data"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "name": "HTTP Request",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest",
      "typeVersion": 3,
      "position": [760, 220]
    }
  ],
  "connections": {
    "convertToHTML": {
      "main": [[ { "node": "HTTP Request", "type": "main", "index": 0 } ]]
    }
  }
}
```
